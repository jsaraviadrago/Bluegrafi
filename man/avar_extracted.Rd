\title{Function to calculate Average variance extracted (AVE)}
\usage{
avar_extracted(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{lavaan object: The name of the model fit that was calculated from the specified CFA model in the lavaan package.}
}
\value{
The output is a data.frame specifying the latent factor in the first column and the AVE in the second column.
}
\description{
This function needs a lavaan object with a model fit to work. It calculates the Average variance extracted for CFA models.
It is the average of the squared standardized pattern coefficients for indicators that depend on the same factor but are specified to measure no other factors.
