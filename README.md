### Package to calculate composite reliability and AVE

This package has 4 functions. One function calculates the Composite reliability and another Average variance extracted (AVE). The other 2 transform lavaan results in tidy tables. 

- crel: This function calculates Composite reliability and it is based on the formulas in Raykov, T. (2004). Behavioral scale realiability and measurement invariance evaluation using latent variable modeling. Behavior therapy, 35, 299-331.

- ave: This function calculates Average variance extracted (AVE) and it is also based on Raykov's paper (Raykov, T. (2004). Behavioral scale realiability and measurement invariance evaluation using latent variable modeling. Behavior therapy, 35, 299-331).

- grafi: This function has its name for one of my cats. It helps organize the lavaan results from CFA models. It gives a list of 3 data frames: model fir indexes, model estimators and modification indexes. 

- blue: This function is called for my other cat. It helps organize information about reliability and organize the output of McDonald's Omega reliability index.
